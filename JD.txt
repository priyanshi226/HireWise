Job Overview
We are looking for a talented and motivated LLM Engineer to join our AI/ML team. The ideal candidate will have hands-on experience with Large Language Models (LLMs), NLP techniques, and deep learning frameworks. You will be responsible for building, fine-tuning, evaluating, and deploying LLM-based solutions that solve real-world problems across various domains.

Key Responsibilities
Design, develop, and fine-tune large-scale NLP models using transformer-based architectures (e.g., GPT, BERT, LLaMA).

Develop robust pipelines for model training, evaluation, and deployment.

Conduct experiments with prompt engineering, in-context learning, and few-shot learning.

Evaluate and improve the performance of LLMs on custom datasets.

Collaborate with product, design, and engineering teams to integrate LLMs into applications.

Stay up-to-date with the latest research and developments in the field of NLP and LLMs.

Requirements
Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, or related field.

Strong knowledge of NLP, deep learning, and transformer architectures.

Proficiency in Python and experience with ML libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.

Experience working with Hugging Face Transformers or OpenAI APIs.

Familiarity with fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and zero/few-shot learning.

Ability to write clean, efficient, and production-ready code.

Preferred Skills
Experience with vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Familiarity with MLOps tools and model deployment pipelines.

Knowledge of data annotation tools and dataset creation.

Contributions to open-source NLP/LLM projects.

Why Join Us?
Work on cutting-edge AI projects that impact millions.

Flexible work hours and remote-friendly culture.

Competitive salary and equity options.

Opportunity to grow with a fast-paced and innovative team.
